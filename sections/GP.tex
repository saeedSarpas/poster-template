    \strut {\small Here is shown the mass of the CGM in our model of the MUSE
      Giant Ly$\alpha$ nebulae as a function of the clumping factor of the cold
      gas. The mass is in units of the maximum baryon mass
      $(\Omega_b/\Omega_m)M_h$, marked as a horizontal dashed line and the
      fiducial values assumed for halo mass and cold gas temperature are $M_h =
      10^{12.3} M_{\odot}$ and $T=2 \times 10^4 K$. The red, blue and black
      lines are for the cold, hot and total gas, respectively. From this follows
      that viable models require a clumping factor $C \approx 300$ and a total
      baryon fraction very close to the cosmological value.}

    \strut {\small Shown in the bottom figure is the minimum total CGM baryon
      fraction (corresponding to equipartition of the the CGM into the cold and
      hot phases), as a function of the two model parameters: halo mass and
      temperature of the cold gas. Low halo masses and high temperatures are
      inconsistent with cosmology for exceeding the universal baryon fraction.
      Only the highest halo masses and the lowest gas temperatures are
      consistent with $f_{CGM} \leq 0.4$, as expected for models with strong ejective
      feedback at high $z$.}
