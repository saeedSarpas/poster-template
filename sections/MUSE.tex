    \strut {\small The Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) is a second
      generation instrument installed on the Nasmyth focus of UT4 at the Very
      Large Telescope (VLT) of the European Southern Observatory (ESO). MUSE is
      a powerful spectrograph fed by a new adaptive optics system. it is
      uniquely well suited to the study of faint galaxies in the early Universe
      as well as to objects in our own solar system.}
